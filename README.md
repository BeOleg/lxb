# LXB - **LX**D **B**uilder

LXB is an attempt to bring a little of the Docker image creation magic to LXD. It's quite a bit simpler than Docker's `Dockerfile` format, since LXC containers don't come with as many bells and whistles as Docker containers (i.e. layered filesystems, exposed ports, volume definitions, etc).

Use `go get` to install: `go get github.com/colebrumley/lxb`. Alternatively, use `glide` to make sure your dependencies are up to date with mine:
```bash
go get github.com/Masterminds/glide
go get -d github.com/colebrumley/lxb
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/colebrumley/lxb
export GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1
glide up
go build
```

Currently you must run LXB on a host running LXD, because LXB looks for the local unix socket. In the future I'd like to add support for calling remote daemons, but for now it's set to look only for a local daemon (you can however work on a remote via the local daemon with the `--remote` flag)

## usage
```bash
NAME:
   lxb - LXD Image Builder

USAGE:
   lxb [global options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   0.0.1

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --lxfile, -f "lxfile.yml"	Path to the build spec
   --context, -c "./"		Path to the build context
   --keep, -k			Don't remove the build container when complete
   --verbose			Print extra debugging output
   --remote "local"		LXD daemon address [$LXB_REMOTE]
```
The process is similar to building a Docker image. Call `lxb` either in the build context directory (only important if your `lxfile.yml` uses `files`), or pass the `-c` flag.

The build config can be supplied by providing nothing (in which case `./lxfile.yml` is loaded), the `--lxfile` flag, or by passing `-` as the first argument (which will read from stdin).

## lxfile usage
Lxfiles are YAML files (just for you @jimmymac) that contain specifications for both the build container and the resulting image.

The only key that is _strictly_ required is `baseimg`, all other keys will be ignored if they are omitted.

**Example:**

```yaml
baseimg: jessie
image_properties:
  description: Apache2 on Debian Jessie x64
image_aliases:
  - jessie-apache2
public: true
build_profiles:
  - default
build_config:
  # See https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/specs/configuration.md#container-configuration
  limits.memory: 512MB
files:
  # Use relative paths from the context directory
  # files will be copied with the same permissions (but owned by root)
  - test.txt:/opt/test.txt
env:
  BUILD_ENV: dev
  CONTAINERIZED: true
  TERM: xterm-color
cmd:
  # A list of commands that will be run inside the container (using /bin/sh)
  - apt-get update
  - apt-get -y install apache2
  - apt-get -y clean
```
